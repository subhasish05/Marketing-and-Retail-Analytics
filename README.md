# Marketing-and-Retail-Analytics
## Project Overview
OList is an e-commerce company that has recently faced financial losses. To reduce costs and improve profitability, efficient inventory management is crucial. In this project, we focus on managing the inventory costs for OList by identifying key products that significantly contribute to overall revenue. Additionally, we employ Market Basket Analysis to gain insights into customer purchasing behaviors, enabling OList to estimate which products are more likely to be purchased together, thus optimizing inventory and marketing strategies.

## Objectives
**Inventory Management:**
Identify top-performing products that contribute the most to the company's revenue. By focusing on these products, OList can streamline inventory management, reduce holding costs, and prevent unnecessary stockpile.

**Market Basket Analysis:**
Using transactional data, analyze the purchasing patterns of individual customers. The goal is to understand customer behavior and identify items that are often bought together, allowing the company to forecast product demands and make informed decisions about stocking and promotional strategies.
